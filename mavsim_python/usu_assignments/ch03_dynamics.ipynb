    "## Problem 0: Implementation\n",
    "Implement the `derivatives` function in `chap3/mav_dynamics.py`using the quaternion form of the dynamics described in equations *(B.1)* through *(B.6)* of *Appendix B* in the book. Note that the dynamics utilized are from the Aerosonde UAV from Table E.2. The first column of these parameters should provide / aid your intuition about what is occuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some useful code snippets and hints:\n",
    "* *st = DynamicState(state):* Extract the numpy matrix into a struct for easy access of states. Note that the *DynamicsState* struct is defined on line 46.\n",
    "* *fm = ForceMoments(forces_moments):* Extract forces and moments into a struct for easy access. Note that the *ForceMoments* struct is defined on line 124.\n",
    "* The momemtum terms are defined in *mav_sim.parameters.aerosonde_parameters.py* and are imported as MAV (i.e., to get $\\Gamma_1$, call *MAV.gamma1*)\n",
    "* Equation *(3.14)* can be used instead of *(B.1)* by converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix using *Quaternion2Rotation(state[IND.QUAT])*\n",
    "* The velocity values can be extracted as a vector as *state[IND.VEL]*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: No Inputs, Zero Initial Conditions\n",
    "For this problem, you will test the dynamics function with no input forces and torques, and all initial velocities set to zero. Set the initial conditions such that the vehicle starts at zero north and east position, and an altitude of 5 meters.  Set the initial attitude (yaw) to $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and zero roll and pitch.  Set all velocities to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: What behavior do you expect (try to be explicit in terms of what different states will do)?\n",
    "**Answer:** The aircraft states will all remain the same except for the altitude. The altitude will decrease because there is no lift on the wings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: Was the behavior as expected? If not, what did you observe differently from what you thought you would? Why did this difference occur?\n",
    "**Answer:** (Answer after completion)"
